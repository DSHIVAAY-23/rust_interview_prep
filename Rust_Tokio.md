### **Tokio:**
**Tokio** Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language that is used to handle concurrency and parallelism. It implements Rust's async/await syntax and helps you write asynchronous programs, allowing you to execute multiple tasks efficiently without excessive thread overhead.

Letâ€™s understand in more detail what Tokio is and how it works.


### **Key Features of Tokio:**

Key Features of Tokio:

1. Concurrency and Parallelism:

Tokio enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks using async/await, making it efficient for high-performance applications.

2. Async IO:

Tokio provides non-blocking Input/Output operations, which means you can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread.

3. Futures and Streams:

When working with Tokio, you need to use Future and Stream types, which represent asynchronous operations.
Future represents a value that will be available at some point in the future.
Stream represents a sequence of values that arrive over time.

4.Multithreading Support:

Tokio allows tasks to run on multiple threads, improving efficiency for large-scale applications.

### **Basic Example of Tokio:**

```rust
use tokio;

async fn say_hello() {
    println!("Hello from Tokio!");
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    say_hello().await;
}
```



### **Example of Concurrency with Tokio:**

```rust
use tokio;

async fn task1() {
    println!("Task 1 started");
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    println!("Task 1 finished");
}

async fn task2() {
    println!("Task 2 started");
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    println!("Task 2 finished");
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tokio::join!(task1(), task2());
}
```




### **6. Async/Await ka Flow:**
When an asynchronous function is called, it does not execute immediately. Instead, Rust treats it as a Future object.
The await keyword makes Rust pause execution until the Future is completed.
Once the Future is resolved, the code following await continues execution.

### **8. Real-World Example:**

Agar aap ek web server bana rahe hain jo requests ko asynchronously handle kare, toh aap **async/await** ka use karenge. Maan lo ek user ne request ki hai jo network se data fetch kar rahi hai:

```rust
use tokio;
use reqwest;

async fn fetch_user_data() -> reqwest::Result<String> {
    let response = reqwest::get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
        .await?
        .text()
        .await?;
    Ok(response)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    match fetch_user_data().await {
        Ok(data) => println!("User Data: {}", data),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

- **`fetch_user_data()`** ek asynchronous function hai jo data ko fetch karta hai.
- **`reqwest::get()`** ka use karke ek HTTP request send ki jaati hai aur **`await`** ka use kiya gaya hai jab tak response nahi milta.
